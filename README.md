# Deep-learning

# Deep Learning Project A1

## Overview
This repository contains our experiments in deep learning, including classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks using Keras and TensorFlow. The work was carried out on datasets like Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, and custom image datasets.

## Objectives
- Experiment with various network architectures (MLP, CNN) on image datasets.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Develop generative models including CAE, VAE, and GAN.
- Explore the application of deep learning techniques in real-world contexts.
